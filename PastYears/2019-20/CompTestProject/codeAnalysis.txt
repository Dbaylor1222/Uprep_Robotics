lines 11-13 are defining the drivetrain:

11 sets up the left motor, the word motor is from the vex package and calls all the pre built code to handle motors. 
Then "LeftDriveSmart" is a veritable name (could be anything just what I am calling the motor) the "=" is assigning that name 
to a motor and then in side the parentheses it is describing the motor. first is the port then the gear ratio inside the 
motor (always will be 1-18 unless we swap out the motor things), then the true/false is witch direction the motor is spinning 
so toggle those to change which way is  forward or reverse.

12 is the same as 11 but for the right motor. The opposite way is forward so the last parameter is true instead of false.

13 sets up the drivetrain. A drivetrain is a special motor group and allowed both motors to be controlled at once. 
Like the motor commands the “drivetrain” with a lowercase d is calling prewritten code that defines a drivetrain. 
Then the “Drivetrain” with an uppercase D is a variable name. Then you define your drive train with the things between the 
parenthesis. First are your two motors, then wheel travel, track width, wheel base, units, and external gear ratio. (not sure what 
the wheel travel, track width, wheel base are but that is what they are called in the underlying code. (CTRL+click on something to
