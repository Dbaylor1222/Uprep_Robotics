# Example code #
The two programs in this folder were was the code used in the 2020-21 season.

Both programs started with a VEX template and utilize a tank drive for the drive train. 
They utlize very similar charts to control state flow but the complex program has more motors 
involved and thus a more complex flow. The more complex program also has the begginings of an
intigrated optical sensor to determin what color of ball is in the robot. This sysem is not
finished or tested but is a good place to start for further sensor implementation.
